# vue-segnn
Simple site for SEG Company.
***
I would like to use some vue.js, bootstrap and, perhaps, node.js techs for developing this site.
Also I would like to deploy this into cloud's env and use docker for this or tried to explore GitHubPaged abilities for site deploying.
***
This is my first freelance project on vue.js.

History:

First sprint statistic:
  - Start works: 11.04.17
  - First sprint start: 17.04.17
  - End First Sprint: 25.04.17
  - Sprint duration: 8 days
***

25.04.17 -> first sprint is over:
  - release first production version of this vue-app;
  - this app has all basic logic, which Customer wanted;
  - create list of issue, which I should fix;
  - write list of features, which I can implement into this project.
Next step is creating plan for the next sprint, which will start on April, 28-29.
***

22.04.17 -> app is growning:
  - use components in single file (app.js), templates are inline javascript string; 
  - now think about gulp for more flexible developing; 
  - tried to deploy site prototype on github pages (fail -> need investigate the reason of issue and fix that);
  - now use node.js/http-server module for getting static content instead of file system.
Great experience with vue.js, js, css/bootstrap ans other related tech when I have worked with this project.
***

19.04.17 -> think about using vue component's into this site. There are several ways:
  - use webpack for this (maybe use this way after all other ways in futute redesign of project);
  - use single-file way and defint components global or local with string-mode templates (hard way);
  - use x-template scripts for define html-templates and use these templates in local or global components;
Today I will try to use x-template way for templates and create some local/global components.
